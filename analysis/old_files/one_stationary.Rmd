This dataset summarizes the experiment of one mobile turtlebot in an environment by itself.

The runtime of this experiment was `r partial_time_hours` hours, `r partial_time_minutes` minutes, and `r partial_time_seconds` seconds.

The filter configuration for this experiment was as follows:

* Continuous filter:
    + odom: x_vel, y_vel, yaw, yaw_vel
    + imu: yaw
* Discrete filter:
    + odom: x_vel, y_vel, yaw_vel

Shown below is the summary of each filter's error for both x and y coordinates, and also the error in total distance.
