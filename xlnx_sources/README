This directory contains two scripts for fetching necessary sources for usingthe Xilinx Zedboard

clone_git_repos can be used to initially clone the git repositories, and pull_git_repos can be used to keep them up to date

Some of these repos are very large, so they are not committed here but can be independently maintained
