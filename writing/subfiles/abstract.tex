Mobile robot localization is one of the fundamental problems of robotics. Without the ability to localize itself in the world, a mobile robot is almost useless. As mobile robotic systems become more common, the need for reliable and cheap state estimation systems has grown. This thesis presents a distributed state estimation system using Kalman filters. This system is implemented on the TurtleBot platform using the Robot Operating System, and performance is evaluated with the Gazebo simulator. We show that performance of the Unscented Kalman Filter can be greatly improved for a mobile robot when the robot's odometry is supplemented with state information obtained from other robot's sensor data.
