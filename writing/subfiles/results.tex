\section{Control Group} \label{sec:Control Group}
First, we must verify that our localization system works well in Gazebo's noiseless environment. To do this, we examine the \gls{con_filter} state estimate error, specifically the horizontal distance and yaw error, for both a stationary robot and a randomly moving robot.

\subsection{Stationary Robot}

\label{fig:one_stationary_noiseless_continuous_error}
\end{figure}

For a stationary robot in a noiseless environment, we can see in \autoref{tab:one_stationary_noiseless_continuous_summary} and \autoref{fig:one_stationary_noiseless_continuous_error} that the \gls{con_filter} tracks the Gazebo ground truth odometry almost perfectly. The maximum horizontal error is $2\times 10^{-6}$ m and the maximum yaw error is $4\times10^{-5}$ radians. These errors would be completely indistinguishable from perfect accuracy in the real world.

\subsection{Mobile Robot}
Next, we examine a mobile robot in a noiseless environment. The robot randomly picks an x and y coordinate and travels to it, and repeats this for the duration of the experiment.

% TODO make all these numbers final for final draft
From \autoref{tab:one_mobile_noiseless_no_gps_continuous_summary} we see that the maximum horizontal distance error is NEEDS FINAL NUMBEr with a mean error of NEEDS FINAL NUMBER. Our robot has a radius of 0.2m, so our position estimate was always located within the radius of the robot. In the real world this error would be virtually undetectable. We also see that our maximum yaw error is NEEDS FINAL NUMBER radians, which is not insignificant, however our mean error is NEEDS FINAL NUMBER radians with a standard deviation of NEEDS FINAL NUMBER, which is very good. \autoref{fig:one_mobile_noiseless_no_gps_continuous_error} shows that our horizontal distance error is much more varied than in the stationary robot simulation, but this is still completely with the bounds of real-world perfection for localization.

\section{Noisy Individual Operation}
As shown in \autoref{sec:Control Group}, our simulation in a noiseless environment functions perfectly. This shows the accuracy of the \gls{ukf} for localization and proves the functionality of our system. Now we show the same statistics for a stationary and mobile individual robot, but with the noise model implemented that was described in \autoref{sec:noise_model}.

\subsection{Stationary Robot}

Comparing \autoref{tab:one_stationary_continuous_summary} to \autoref{tab:one_stationary_noiseless_no_gps_continuous_summary}, it is difficult to see a difference between the accuracy of the filter in the noisy vs. noiseless environment. However examining \autoref{fig:one_stationary_noisy_continuous_error} vs. \autoref{fig:one_stationary_noiseless_no_gps_continuous_error}, it is clear the the addition of noise has affected the error of the filter. But this error is still so small that the filter is performing with what is realistically perfection. This is as we expect, because a stationary robot should have virtually no error. We can see this by looking at the noise model in \autoref{tab:sample_motion_model_odometry}. As the difference between $\bar{x}_{t-1}$ and $\bar{x}_t$ approaches 0, the standard deviations of our noise will also approach 0, and this means there will be virtually no noise in the readings.

\subsection{Mobile Robot} \label{sec:Mobile Robot}

\label{fig:one_mobile_continuous_error}
\end{figure}

For the mobile robot, we see the effects of our noise model. The robot accumulates up to a maximum 30 meters of horizontal position error over its almost 30 minutes of operation. We also see a great increase in the yaw error, with a mean that is still close to 0 but a standard deviation of almost 2 radians.

This test of the mobile robot shows that our noise model is working as desired, and giving us a realistic model of odometry drift that a robot might see.

\input{autogenerated_tables/one_mobile_discrete_summary.tex}

\label{fig:one_mobile_discrete_error}
\end{figure}

For the single mobile robot we also examine the error in the discrete filter, shown in \autoref{tab:one_mobile_discrete_summary} and \autoref{fig:one_mobile_discrete_error}. For a single robot experiment, this filter receives only the robot's odometry and GPS as inputs. This acts as our control experiment for the discrete filter, we expect to see increased accuracy with the addition of the external pose readings. We see that the addition of the GPS greatly increases the accuracy of the filter.

\section{Noisy Group Operation}
Finally, we operate with mobile robots in a group. For this experiments, we are not concerned with information about the \gls{con_filter}, because we have already proved its functionality in the preceding sections. Because the \gls{con_filter}'s only input is the robot's odometry, no changes will be seen when operating individually vs. in a group.

What does change is the \gls{disc_filter}. Operating in a group means the \gls{disc_filter} now receives external pose measurements from other robots. \autoref{tab:two_mobile_discrete_summary} and \autoref{fig:two_mobile_discrete_error} show the error of the discrete filter with two robots operating in the same environment.

\input{autogenerated_tables/two_mobile_discrete_summary.tex}

\begin{figure}

\caption{Error of \gls{disc_filter} for Mobile Robots with Noisy Odometry Over Time}
\label{fig:two_mobile_discrete_error}
\end{figure}

From this, we see marked increase in accuracy when the robots operate in a group and share sensor information with each other. In the experiments summarized in \autoref{tab:two_mobile_discrete_summary} and \autoref{tab:one_mobile_discrete_summary}, the robots also had a GPS to help them localize. This obscures some of the accuracy gains that are made from including the distributed state estimates. \autoref{tab:one_mobile_no_gps_discrete_summary} and \autoref{tab:two_mobile_no_gps_discrete_summary} show the results of the same experiments when they are run without a GPS. The accumulated drift in both experiments is great enough that it is rendered unusable for useful navigation, however the external pose measurements reduce the mean error by an order of magnitude.
