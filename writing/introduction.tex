This is an introduction.

\section{Problem Statement}
Now, I specify the exact localization problem that this thesis addresses. Our system contains the following assumptions and constraints.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $M$ independent mobile robots operating in a planar environment.
\item Wireless communication abilities between all robots in the environment.
\item No known map of environment, but GPS for localization in a world frame is available.
\item Localization must be able to seamlessly transition between operating with and without pose estimates from other robots.
\item Minimize complexity and added computations to Extended Kalman Filters used for localization.
\end{enumerate}
