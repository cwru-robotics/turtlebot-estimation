As mobile robotic systems become increasingly more popular, the need for reliable state estimation systems has also increased. This thesis examines the feasibility of a distributed state estimation system using Kalman filters, and its resilience to erroneous or compromised sensor measurements. This system is implemented on the TurtleBot platform using the Robot Operating System, and performance is evaluated with the Gazebo simulator.
