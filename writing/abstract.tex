Mobile robot localization is one of the fundamental problems of robotics. Without the ability to localize itself in the world, a mobile robot is almost useless. As mobile robotic systems become more present, the need for reliable and cheap state estimation systems has grown. The increasing coverage of wireless networks and density of network cyber-physical systems has lead to an opportunity for distributed systems coordinated between multiple agents. This thesis examines the feasibility of a distributed state estimation system using Kalman filters, and its resilience to erroneous or compromised sensor measurements. This system is implemented on the TurtleBot platform using the Robot Operating System, and performance is evaluated with the Gazebo simulator.
